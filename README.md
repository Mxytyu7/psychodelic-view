# psychodelic-view
Hello, psychedelic view is an small project made by me (mxytyu) to research effects of drugs and their views (can even help in movies because most movies does not have an "real view" of psychedelics and other drugs (This project is made to simulate the view of somebody using lsd, mdma, mushrooms,... on an video or image.)
